## <center> Frequently Asked Questions <center>


# Do I need to know how to dance to attend Lindy on Sproul?

Absolutely not! We offer beginner lessons at every Lindy on Sproul event, and we strive to create an inclusive and non-judgemental learning environment.

# Do I need to pay to attend Lindy on Sproul classes?

Nope! Our classes are **free**.

# What are "roles" in swing dancing?

Broadly speaking, there are two roles in a partnered swing dance: the **lead** and the **follow**. The lead selects moves and initiates the movements in a dance. The follow responds to the lead's suggestions.  

# Who can lead and who can follow?

Anyone can lead or follow!  We at Lindy on Sproul are strongly committed to the idea that dancing roles are not tied to gender identity or expression.  We highly recommend that dancers eventually learn both roles (often referred to as *ambidancing*) for a number of reasons:

<ol>
    <li> Both roles are fun and offer their own challenges and opportunities for growing as a dancer. </li>
    <li> When you can dance both roles, you can dance with anyone on the floor. </li>
    <li> Complementarity: learning how to follow makes you a better lead, and learning how to lead makes you a better follow. </li>
</ol>

That being said, it is OK to have a preferred role, and we do recommend that dancers choose one role to work on for their first few lessons.

# Do I need a dance partner to come to Lindy on Sproul?

No partner required! For our dance lessons, we rotate partners frequently, so you will meet and dance with many different partners.

# Do you hold classes when it rains?

Yes we do! We will move to Cesar Chavez tunnel (down the stairs and to the right of our usual venue on Upper Sproul) if weather conditions become unfavourable. An annoucement will be posted to this website and to our Facebook page if we are holding our class and social dance at a different location so look out for that!

# Do you hold classes over semester breaks/public holidays?

Yup! You can assume that we will be hosting Lindy on Sproul every Saturday. An annoucement will be posted to this website and to our Facebook page if we are not.

# What other opportunities are there for me to practice social dancing?

We encourage you to attend our monthly night socials Lindy at Night. Details on when and where these socials are going to be will be announced on Facebook and on this website.   

Outside of Berkeley, *Lindy by the Lake* is another fun event you may want to check out. It takes place on the last Saturday of every month by the Lake Merritt East 18th Street Pier.

If you are a Berkeley student, you should also consider joining our DeCal.

# How can I contact you?
