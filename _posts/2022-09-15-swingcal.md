## SwingCal Plans This Fall

This semester, SwingCal will not be an official DeCal, but we will still be teaching a progressive, beginner-friendly swing dancing course.

We will be meeting every Tuesday Night from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM in Hearst Gym 237. Each week you can join us for:
* A beginner and intermediate partner dancing lesson
* A solo jazz lesson
* A history and culture of swing lesson
* Mentor groups for personalized feedback
* A social dancing practica in which you can practice the new moves you've learned in a supportive and fun environment.

After SwingCal, we usually migrate to get food somewhere on Southside, and we'd love to have you join us and become a part of our cozy little swing community hear on campus!

Hope to see you there!
