## Nightmare on Sproul: A Very Spooky Lindy at Night
### Campanile Esplanade, 22 October 2022 at 7:00 PM

Arise from your Lavender Coffins and join us for Nightmare on Sproul! Wear your spookiest costumes and boogie on down for a free outdoor swing dance beginning at 7pm on October 22nd at Campanile Esplanade. We will have light snacks, drinks, candy, and spooky decor to kick off our first Lindy at Night of this semester!

The venue is 100% free and open to the public! We will hold a beginner lesson taught by Berkeley dancers from 7 to 7:30pm. Then, from 7:30pm on, we will dance our hearts out to music brought to you by our lovely Berkeley DJs.

Note: no partner or experience is necessary!
